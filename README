# Stealth
Stealth from Asset Store adopted for Unity 2018.3</br>
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/stealth-unity-4x-7677

It was upgraded with Unity autoupgrade API with some manual tuning.

Maybe upgrade was not accurate but at the first sight it looks OK.

Lightmaps and navigation are still broken.
